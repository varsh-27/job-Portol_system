## Overview

Job Portal System is a web application designed to connect job seekers with employers. It streamlines the hiring process and makes job searching efficient and user-friendly.

## How the Project Works

- **User Registration & Authentication:**  
  Job seekers and employers can register and log in to access the platform.

- **Profile Management:**  
  Users can build and update their profiles. Job seekers can upload resumes and list skills, while employers can manage their company profiles.

- **Job Posting & Search:**  
  Employers post new job opportunities. Job seekers can browse, search, and filter jobs based on various criteria such as location, role, and skills.

- **Application Process:**  
  Job seekers can apply for jobs directly through the portal. Employers can manage applications, shortlist candidates, and communicate with applicants.

- **Dashboards:**  
  Both job seekers and employers have personalized dashboards to track applications, job postings, and other relevant information.
